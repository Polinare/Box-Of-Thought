Each category covering a number, area and value for easier computations. Totals had been grouped together as well at the earlier part of the Data Frame. Performing Analysis is difficult given that number, area and value are separated one category after the other. Given that all values are numeric, easier computation could be made if there was a separate Data Frame containing the arrangement, Number - Total Number - Area - Total Area - Value - Total Value, for a different take.
